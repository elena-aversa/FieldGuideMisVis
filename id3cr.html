These will not be used alot nor will they even be provided to ukraine (yet that is). The standard M107 shell has a range of 15 miles, base bleed has 18 miles or the new M795 wich has a max range of 23 miles. Again, are these provided to ukraine? 2. CAESAR's were developed around an ERFB round, the good stuff. 26 miles. But will ukraine get these shells? Or the older obusier shells? Most likely they will get the ERFB's because CAESAR is designed around them. They also have a further extended range shell that goes 30 miles3. The russians have insanely long ranged and powerfull artillery pieces. But most are soviet era. Like the 2S7 Pion 203mm guns. used by both sides, captured by both sides. Standard simple HE shell range is 23 miles.... Extended goes to 40 miles. We havent talked about the 155mm 2S5. " <br>

                  <p>In conclusion, the range arrow chart is a moderately misleading data visualisation, which means it can mislead the reader even if moderately. üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>
                  <p>This data visualisation was shared on 9gag with a confirming post, indicating that who posted it did not question the information visualised. 
                    This also means that, without a critical approach, it would be easy for us to trust its message. üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>
                    <p> In the comment section however, users exposed the misleaaging nature of the data visualisation, though not all of them did so. üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>
                    <p>This teaches us to always critically approach data visualisation on a social network, especially during times of social instability (like the Russo-Ukrainian war).
                        Always carefully consider the misleading potential, the post‚Äôs stance, and the comments‚Äô stance</span> as well.</p>
